Welcome to loopy's documentation!
=================================

loopy is a code generator for array-based code in the OpenCL/CUDA execution
model. Here's a very simple example of how to double the entries of a vector
using loopy:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/python/hello-loopy.py
   :end-before: ENDEXAMPLE

This example is included in the :mod:`loopy` distribution as
:download:`examples/python/hello-loopy.py <../examples/python/hello-loopy.py>`.

When you run this script, the following kernel is generated, compiled, and executed:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/python/hello-loopy.cl
    :language: c

(See the full example for how to print the generated code.)
