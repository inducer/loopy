    """Construct a sequential dependency specification between each instruction
    and the instruction immediately before it. This takes the order of statements
    in :attr:`loopy.LoopKernel.instructions` and considers the inames (loops) within
    which each statement is nested. Within the sequence of statements,
    each iname must apply to a contiguous region, allowing us to speak of
    a 'loop entry' and a 'loop exit' point. Loops/inames must nest properly,
    i.e. entry and exit points of a loop/iname must occur nested within
    the same outer loop structure.

    Based on this understanding of the presented kernel, this routine adds
    a dependency structure (see :class:`~loopy.HappensAfter`) copmatible
    with a C program consisting of the same loop nest, i.e. statements
    within the same loop nest obeying *lexicographic* ordering.

    If inames are perfectly nested (i.e. both entry/exit points coincide),
    the nesting of the two loops is undefined.
