    r"""For each statement pair in a subset of all statement pairs found in a
    linearized kernel, determine the (relative) order in which the statement
    instances are executed. For each pair, represent this relative ordering
    using three ``statement instance orderings`` (SIOs):

    - The intra-thread SIO: A :class:`islpy.Map` from each instance of the
      first statement to all instances of the second statement that occur
      later, such that both statement instances in each before-after pair are
      executed within the same work-item (thread).

    - The intra-group SIO: A :class:`islpy.Map` from each instance of the first
      statement to all instances of the second statement that occur later, such
      that both statement instances in each before-after pair are executed
      within the same work-group (though potentially by different work-items).

    - The global SIO: A :class:`islpy.Map` from each instance of the first
      statement to all instances of the second statement that occur later, even
      if the two statement instances in a given before-after pair are executed
      within different work-groups.

    :arg knl: A preprocessed :class:`loopy.LoopKernel` containing the
        linearization items that will be used to create the SIOs.

    :arg lin_items: A list of :class:`loopy.schedule.ScheduleItem`
        (to be renamed to `loopy.schedule.LinearizationItem`) containing all
        linearization items for which SIOs will be created. To allow usage of
        this routine during linearization, a truncated (i.e. partial)
        linearization may be passed through this argument.

    :arg stmt_id_pairs: A sequence containing pairs of statement identifiers.

    :returns: A dictionary mapping each two-tuple of statement identifiers
        provided in `stmt_id_pairs` to a
        :class:`~loopy.schedule.checker.schedule.StatementOrdering`, which
        contains the three SIOs described above.
