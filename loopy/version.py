Loopy Language Versioning
-------------------------

At version 2018.1, :mod:`loopy` introduced a language versioning scheme to make
it easier to evolve the language while retaining backward compatibility. What
prompted this is the addition of
:attr:`loopy.Options.enforce_variable_access_ordered`, which (despite
its name) serves to enable a new check that helps ensure that all variable
access in a kernel is ordered as intended. Since that has the potential to
break existing programs, kernels now have to declare support for a given
language version to let them take advantage of this check.

As a result, :mod:`loopy` will now issue a warning when a call to
:func:`loopy.make_kernel` does not declare a language version. Such kernels
will (indefinitely) default to language version 2017.2.1.  If passing a
language version to :func:`make_kernel` is impractical, you may also import
one of the ``LOOPY_USE_LANGUAGE_VERSION_...`` symbols given below using::

    from loopy.version import LOOPY_USE_LANGUAGE_VERSION_2018_2

in the global namespace of the function calling :func:`make_kernel`. If
*lang_version* in that call is not explicitly given, this value will be used.

Language versions will generally reflect the version number of :mod:`loopy` in
which they were introduced, though it is likely that most versions of
:mod:`loopy` do not introduce language incompatibilities. In such
situations, the previous language version number remains. (In fact, we
will work hard to avoid backward-incompatible language changes.)

.. data:: MOST_RECENT_LANGUAGE_VERSION

    A tuple representing the most recent language version number of loopy, for
    example **(2018, 1)**. Direct comparison of these tuples will always
    yield valid version comparisons.

    :attr:`loopy.Options.ignore_boostable_into` is turned on by default.

    :attr:`loopy.Options.enforce_variable_access_ordered`
    is turned on by default.

.. data:: LOOPY_USE_LANGUAGE_VERSION_2017_2_1

    Initial legacy language version.
